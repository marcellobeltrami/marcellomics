My name is Marcello and I am a passionate bioinformatician working at the University of York. On the daily, I explore the genomic landscape of bladder cancer. Outside work I enjoy parkour, climbing, gaming and low-level coding.

This blog is where I share my thoughts and experiences on technologies in bioinformatics, intersting frameworks, tools review and more!
